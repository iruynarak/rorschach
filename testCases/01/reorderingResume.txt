 per second relative to their peers. But in recent years, astronomers have found a dozen or so "hypervelocity stars" traveling at up to   at least an order of magnitude faster than this, albeit while gravitationally bound. Now a pair of astrophysicists have discovered a mechanism that would free these stars, sending them rocketing into intergalactic space at speeds in excess of 100,000 kilometers per second. That's more than a third of the speed of light.  That's interesting because these stars will be cosmological messengers that can tell us about the conditions in other parts of the universe  they could also be responsible for spreading life throughout the cosmos. Stars in the Milky Way typically travel at a few hundred kilometers 1000 kilometers per second, fast enough to escape our galaxy entirely. 100,000 of these stars in every cubic gigaparsec of space and that the next generation of space telescopes will be sensitive to spot them. when they formed. And because these stars can travel across much of the observable universe throughout their lifetimes,  They calculate that there should be about And they have observed stars orbiting the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy traveling
